This is a small utility for calculating ELO scores after a match  
It also calculates the fairest match given a certain player

This is based on a scale from 0 to 1 so use an apropriate function to map the results when using it

please note that while tests are missing and the read me is incomplete the project itself it's completed feel free to use it :)
